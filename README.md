import mediapipe as mp

# Initialize MediaPipe Hands
mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands
hands = mp_hands.Hands()
mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils

# Open webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Convert the frame to RGB
    image = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

    # Process the frame with MediaPipe
    result = hands.process(image)

    # Draw hand landmarks
    if result.multi_hand_landmarks:
        for hand_landmarks in result.multi_hand_landmarks:
            mp_drawing.draw_landmarks(frame, hand_landmarks, mp_hands.HAND_CONNECTIONS)

    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow('Hand Tracking', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == 27:
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
